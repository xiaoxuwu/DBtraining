      Nine UCLA alumni joined the cast of “Frozen – Live at the Hyperion,”
      performing as Elsa, Olaf, Hans, Kristoff or the ensemble. The live
      adaptation of the 2013 Disney animated film “Frozen” currently plays three
      times a day at Disney California Adventure after opening in May. Each
      week, the Daily Bruin will share alumni’s experiences working at the
      Happiest Place on Earth.

      Christopher Culberson and Travis Leland are now two of six actors playing
      the lead male in Disney’s live musical theater version of “Frozen.” For each
      principal role, Disney cast six actors who rotate each performance since
      “Frozen – Live at the Hyperion” runs every day. Actors not only interpret
      their own characters, but must also react to other characters’ choices on
      short notice.
